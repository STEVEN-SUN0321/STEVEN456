    <section>
        <p>We are now living in the information age, where data has become one of the most important assets for individuals, companies, and even countries. With the widespread use of the Internet and the rapid development of technology, the sharing and storage of information have become more convenient than ever before. However, this convenience also brings unprecedented risks. Information security is essential to protect data from unauthorized access, use, tampering, or destruction. Whether it is preventing personal privacy leaks or safeguarding corporate secrets, information security plays a vital role in modern society. This paper will explore the main threats to information security, current protection measures, and the possible challenges this field may face in the future.</p>

        
        <p>With advancements in technology and the widespread use of the Internet, information security faces increasing threats. These threats come not only from technical vulnerabilities but also from human attacks and social engineering methods. <strong>Cyberattacks</strong> are among the most common threats. Hackers use malware, viruses, and other techniques to gain unauthorized access to systems and networks to steal, alter, or destroy data. For example, Kaseya, a U.S.-based remote management software provider, experienced a supply chain attack on July 2, 2021. Attackers exploited Kaseya's VSA product, infecting customer machines with ransomware. News reports indicated that between 800 and 1,500 small and medium-sized companies were impacted by the REvil ransomware as a result of the attack (Imperva).</p>

        <p>In another example, Chinese aircraft parts maker FACC lost nearly $60 million in a "CEO fraud scam," where scammers impersonated top executives and tricked employees into transferring funds (Tessian). These incidents illustrate how social engineering attacks can have devastating consequences for companies.</p>

       
        <p>As a result of these growing threats, awareness of the importance of information security has increased. To address these challenges, various measures have been implemented. Governments, for instance, have introduced laws to prevent data breaches and other security issues. The <strong>Digital Privacy Act (SC 2015, Chapter 32)</strong> in Canada criminalizes breaches of certain security safeguards, reinforcing legal protections for personal data (Branch).</p>

        <p>Furthermore, educational institutions have also played a significant role in raising awareness about information security. Universities, for example, have implemented strict policies to protect student data. According to the <strong>MIT Privacy of Student Records Policy</strong>, the college cannot disclose personally identifiable information from a student’s education records without the student's prior consent (“Privacy of Student Records”).</p>

       
        <p>Overall, in the face of increasingly complex threats, a multi-layered protection system that combines legal frameworks, educational efforts, and technical measures is crucial. Enhancing information security is essential given the diverse range of cyberattack methods. The future of information security holds broad prospects. Through global cooperation, continuous innovation, and heightened attention to security measures, we can create a safer and more private digital environment for future generations.</p>
